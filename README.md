Cardboard helps teams coordinate solving [puzzle hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt). It manages and organizes puzzles, keeps track of team members, integrates with other solving tools, and more.

For help **using Cardboard as a solver**, see [here](user-guide.md).

For help **setting Cardboard up for a hunt**, see [here](new-hunt-setup.md).
