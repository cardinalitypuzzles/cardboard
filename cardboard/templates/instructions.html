          The URL for our cardboard dashboard
          is <a href="http://unseen-cardboard-2022.herokuapp.com/">http://unseen-cardboard-2022.herokuapp.com/</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Log in</dt>
        <dd>You should already have been added to the list of users
        with access to
        our <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Cd6au1sEPd0HYDfEoeTFT1JqKCPwshdl">google
        drive directory</a> for this years hunt. Use this same google
        account to log in with google at the bottom of the home
        page.<br>  If this doesn't work, see our troubleshooting page.
        </dd>
        <dt>Pick a hunt</dt>
        <dd>
          After logging on, you may be shown a list of hunts. Choose
          the 2022 MIT Mystery Hunt. This won't exist until we have a
          URL.
        </dd>
        <dt>Add a puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          Once you pick a hunt, there will be a list of existing
          puzzles. If the puzzle you want to work on isn't there,
          click the "Add Puzzle" button in the upper right hand
          corner. Type in the name of the puzzle and copy the URL from
          your browser header. If the puzzle is a meta puzzle, click
          the "Is meta" checkbox.
          <br>
          The puzzle spreadsheet will be created in the Mystery Hunt
          2022 Folder. Please move it to the folder for the
          corresponding round or meta if this is easy for you. Someone
          else will do it if you don't, but it's helpful for folks not
          using the dashboard. The system won't move the sheet once
          it's created. We plan to add autosorting next year, but
          haven't had time this year. The system will rename the
          puzzle when it's solved, so changing the name won't stick.
          <br>
          If someone else creates the puzzle while you're typing, the
          system won't let you create it. A red box with the text
          "There is already a puzzle with this name." will show
          up. The puzzle should automatically appear, but if it
          doesn't, reload the page. This will occur if the name or the
          URL matches, so if there are multiple puzzles with the same
          name in this year's hunt, just add the name of the meta in
          parentheses or something.
        </dd>
        <dt>Set the meta of a puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          Whenever a meta is created, the system will create a tag
          named after that meta. To set the meta of a puzzle, simply
          add that tag to the puzzle. See the next section.
          <br>
          A puzzle can have multiple meta tags which will cause the
          solution to be added to the spreadsheet of each of the metas.
        </dd>
        <dt>Add a tag to a puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          The rightmost column of the puzzle list is the list of tags
          and metas for the given puzzle. There will be a plus symbol
          in this column. If the puzzle already has tags, it will be
          at the end of the list of tags.
          <br>
          Clicking the plus button will cause a modal dialog to pop up
          asking what tags you want to add. There will be a list of
          metas at the top, a list of existing tags below that, and a
          text box where you can enter new tags. Click on as many tags
          as apply to this puzzle (including the tag for its meta
          puzzle). Clicking on a tag a second time will unselect it,
          or you can click on the x in its bubble on the main
          dashboard.
          <br>
          To create a new tag, type in any string, choose a
          color (they can be white or blue. The only distinction is
          that white tags are sorted before blue tags in the list),
          then click the "Create" button. Any tags you create will
          automatically be added to the current puzzle. When you're
          done, click the "Done" button.
        </dd>
        <dt>Submit a guess for a puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          To submit a guess for a puzzle, go to the hunt page for that
          puzzle. There will be a link in the "Puzzle" column of the
          dashboard that will take you there and a link in the
          standard place in the corresponding spreadsheet. Submit the
          answer there. If it's correct, proceed to the next
          section. If it's not, you can go back to working on the
          puzzle or go do something else. Up to you.
          <br>
          If you're used to other cardboard instances, you may be used
          to submitting answers through cardboard and having someone
          whose job it is to submit guesses to the hunt website. We do
          not have such a team.
        </dd>
        <dt>Tell cardboard about a correct answer</dt>
        <dd>
          Once the hunt website has told you that your answer is correct, you can mark it here. Click on the "Enter Correct Answer" button. A dialog titled "Enter Correct Answer for &lt;puzzle name&gt;" will show up. Enter the correct answer and hit Submit. If you got here by accident, hit cancel.
          <br>
          This will have 4 effects.
          <ul>
            <li>Show the correct answer on the dashboard and turn the row for that puzzle green.</li>
            <li>Change the title of the spreadsheet to include the correct answer.</li>
            <li>Add the answer to the AUTOGENERATED tab of any associated metas.</li>
            <li>Announce that the puzzle was solved in discord.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Fix it if I entered the wrong information</dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you named a puzzle incorrectly or gave the wrong
              URL, there is a pencil icon next to the name which you can
              use to fix it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you created a second instance of a puzzle because
              of typos, there is a trash can icon next to the name which
              you can use to delete one of the puzzles. Doing so doesn't
              delete the spreadsheet, it just renames it, so if someone
              already started work, you can copy the data over.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you entered an incorrect answer and know the correct
              answer (confirmed by the hunt website), there's a pencil
              icon next to your answer which will let you change it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you entered an incorrect answer and don't know the
              correct answer, there's a trash can icon next to the
              answer. Deleting all the answers for a puzzle will
              change its state back to "SOLVING", rename the
              spreadsheet, and so forth.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you created an extra hunt on the hunts page, let
              clahey or AlanBM know and they will take care of it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Change the status of a puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          There is a status column in the dashboard. It defaults to
          SOLVING, but can be changed to STUCK or EXTRACTION if you
          want to communicate this state. This does not change the
          name of the spreadsheet, but it does color the row in the
          dashboard red.
          <br>
          Once a puzzle is solved, this column will change to
          SOLVED. You can change it here, but in general, it's
          preferable to delete the incorrect answers and let the
          system change it. The main reason I can think of that you
          wouldn't do this is if you know a puzzle has two answers,
          but you only know one of them. In that case, enter the
          single correct answer and then change the status back to
          SOLVING one of the other states.
        </dd>
        <dt>Find documents related to the puzzle</dt>
        <dd>
          There are three columns related to finding the puzzle in
          other places.
          <br>
          The "Puzzle" column contains links to the puzzle on the
          mystery hunt web page (or whatever URL was entered when
          creating the puzzle.
          <br>
          The "Sheet" column contains links to the google spreadsheet
          corresponding to this puzzle.
          <br>
          The "Channel" column contains links to the discord channel
          for this puzzle. There is a radio button above the list of
          puzzles ("Chat version: O App O Web") where you can tell the
          dashboard whether to open discord in an app or on the web.
        </dd>
        <dt>Make the page not so bright</dt>
        <dd>
          There's a toggle in the upper right hand corner that will
          let you switch between light and dark mode.
        </dd>
        <dt>Find the Google Drive folder</dt>
        <dd>
          There's a link labeled "Google Drive Folder üé®üñåÔ∏èüìÅ" that will
          take you to a folder called "FOLDER FOR HUMANS". This link
          will replace the dashboard, so you probably want to open it
          in a new tab/window. This folder will be a child of the 2022
          Hunt folder and you can click on "2022 Hunt" in the list of
          directories at the top of the page. You are also welcome to
          use the "FOLDER FOR HUMANS" if you want to, but it's not
          required.
        </dd>
        <dt>Find Tools to help solve puzzles</dt>
        <dd>
          Click on "Tools and References" on the top of the
          page. Links on this page replace the dashboard, so you
          probably want to open them in a new tab/window.  Click on
          "Unseen Cardboard" to get back to the puzzle list.
        </dd>
        <dt>See stats about how we're doing.</dt>
        <dd>
          Click on the Stats button above the puzzle list. Click on
          "Unseen Cardboard" to get back to the puzzle list.
